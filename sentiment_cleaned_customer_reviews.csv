The one Starbucks store close to us (1 1/2 miles) has been out of espresso pods the three times we have stopped by. The only dark roast is Verona, and that same store has had only decaf on two occasions. I'm wishing I had bought a Keurig instead, as availability of Starbucks coffee is much better.

Jane,"Longview, WA",2011-11-05,1.0,"Starbucks has implemented a ""one button"" entry for a Peppermint White Chocolate Mocha as part of their holiday promotion. This button rings the drink up as a single item, costing $4.75 for a Venti sized drink. Prior to this programming change, the same drink would come through the receipt as a White Chocolate Mocha costing $4.25 with a separate line item for the Peppermint costing $.50. This difference is not visible to the consumer until the conclusion of their transaction. When the customer pays with a Starbucks Gold Card, the modifier charge is removed, reducing the price of the drink by $.50 -- one of the specific benefits of the Gold Card.
